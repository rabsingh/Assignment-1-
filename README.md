## Design Decisions

### Wireframes
- Home Page: The homepage focuses on simplicity, with a prominent call to action encouraging users to take a mental health assessment.
- Color Scheme: The website uses calming tones, primarily light greys and blues, to evoke a sense of tranquility and comfort.
- Fonts: A mix of Courier New for the header (to give a professional, old-school typewriter feel) and sans-serif fonts for the body text for readability.

### Accessibility Considerations
- **Color Contrast**: Text and background colors meet WCAG guidelines for color contrast, ensuring readability for users with visual impairments.
- **Alt Text**: All images are equipped with descriptive `alt` tags, ensuring screen reader compatibility for visually impaired users.
